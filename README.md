# [ELEN133 Digital Signal Processing](http://syllabi.engr.scu.edu/rschaffer/ELEN-133-Spring-2016-35245.xml)

## Catalog Description:
Discrete signals and systems. Difference equations. Convolution summation. Z-transform, transfer function, system response, stability. Digital filter design and implementation. Frequency domain analysis. Discrete Fourier transform and FFT. Audio and video examples. Laboratory for real-time processing. Prerequisite: ELEN 110 or both ELEN 50 and COEN 19.


## Expected Learning Outcomes:
This is an elective course suitable for juniors or seniors in Electrical or Computer Engineering.
1.	The first objective of the course is to build an understanding of the process, restrictions, and implications of using digital representations of continuous time analog signals. Students should be able to specify the most basic DSP system parameters required for specific performance objectives. These parameters include the sampling interval, the number of bits used for quantization, the type of quantization, and the length of the filter or data record needed for processing.
2.	A second objective of the course is to develop methods for analyzing and designing digital signal processing systems and components. The components include digital filters, modulators, decimators, interpolators, analog to digital converters, and digital to analog converters. The methods include time domain analysis and difference equations, frequency domain analysis and filter specification, the appropriate use of the many transformations between discrete time and frequency, and bilinear transformations to use analog filter design techniques for digital filter design.
3.	A third objective of the course is to develop an understanding of the capability of modern software tools and hardware implementations for digital signal processing.


## Homework:
Weekly homework will be posted on Camino on Thursdays and will be due at 11:59pm on the following Thursday. Solutions will be posted after the due date and graded homework will usually be available on Camino by the following Wednesday. Collaboration on homework is allowed, however, copying is not allowed. While it is useful, at times, to collaborate, the goal of homework is to learn how to apply the concepts. Even if you understand answers that have been discovered as a group, it is important to make sure that you can solve all problems on your own. This course will be testing your ability to apply your knowledge - not necessarily to solve problems that you have already solved.


## Textbook Discussion:
The book is technically optional. All required material will come from the lecture and course notes. The book should provide a good parallel resource if needed. If you do not already have the book, a couple of options exist that could reduce the cost. If desired, you should feel free to work with the book store or use other resources to obtain a more economical copy of the book. Renting the book may be an option.


## MATLAB:
This course will have a healthy mix of theory and practical application in the form of MATLAB. Knowing MATLAB is NOT a prerequisite and we will be easing into it with introductory level assignments. Undergraduates taking ELEN133L will also get a heavy dose of MATLAB in the lab. Homework assignments will have some MATLAB problems.
